Most of them duplicated\r\nthe `thead` with another one, which was just bizarre, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis plugin instead creates an HTML5 `header` element, which duplicates the html and spacing of the\r\n`th` elements contained within the `thead` of a table.  This makes more sense to me, since divs can take\r\nany `position` styling you want, **and** it allows you to use border-collapsing on your tables with ease (one of my requirements).\r\n\r\n### License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Kevin Whitaker\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and \r\nassociated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, \r\nincluding without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, \r\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is \r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or \r\nsubstantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, \r\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\nPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
